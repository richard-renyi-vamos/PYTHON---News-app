create a python script that shows the news in a popup screen
ChatGPT
To create a Python script displaying news in a popup screen, you can use the tkinter library for the GUI and fetch news using a news API like NewsAPI. First, you'll need to install the tkinter library if you haven't already and get an API key from NewsAPI.

Here's an example script that utilizes tkinter to display news in a popup window using the requests library to fetch news from NewsAPI:

python
Copy code
import requests
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import messagebox

# Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual NewsAPI key
NEWS_API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
NEWS_API_ENDPOINT = 'https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines'
COUNTRY_CODE = 'hu'  # Replace with the desired country code

def fetch_news():
    params = {
        'country': COUNTRY_CODE,
        'apiKey': NEWS_API_KEY
    }
    response = requests.get(NEWS_API_ENDPOINT, params=params)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        news_data = response.json()
        articles = news_data['articles']
        news_titles = "\n\n".join([f"- {article['title']}" for article in articles])
        show_popup(news_titles)
    else:
        show_popup("Failed to fetch news. Please try again later.")

def show_popup(news):
    root = tk.Tk()
    root.withdraw()  # Hide the main window

    messagebox.showinfo("Latest News", news)

    root.mainloop()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    fetch_news()
Remember to replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual NewsAPI key. This script fetches the top headlines from Hungary (COUNTRY_CODE = 'hu') and displays them in a pop-up window using tkinter's messagebox.

Please note that you need an active internet connection to fetch the news, and you may need to adjust the code further based on your preferences or error handling needs.
